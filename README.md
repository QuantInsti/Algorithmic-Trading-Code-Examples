# Algorithmic Trading Code Examples
#### Welcome to this repository where you'll find the code scripts of the QuantInsti Blog articles

## Introduction 

This folder contains different Python and R scripts you can use to learn how to trade in the financial markets algorithmically. These code scripts come from the QuantInsti Blog where we publish content related to algorithmic trading. Usually, we have for each Blog, a code script where we develop a trading strategy, a model algorithm, a new technique in the algo trading space, etc. This repository serves the purpose of finding all those code scripts in a single place. Please enjoy the most of it by searching your specific topic, find the code and tweak as per your own trading needs.

## Disclaimer
**The code scripts and/or their strategies are just templates. You should only use them for live trading with appropriate backtesting and tweaking strategy parameters.**

1. Cautionary note <a id='one'></a>
   
    - Trading is not appropriate for all investors and carries a significant risk.
    - Markets are unpredictable, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes.
    - The code scripts and the strategies/techniques/models provided here are for educational purposes only; they are not investing advice.
2. Limitations and assumptions <a id='two'></a>
    - Trading experience: The code scripts and the strategies/techniques/models provided here assume that traders possess the necessary expertise to apprehend the risks and customize the templates according to their risk tolerance and preferences.
    - Risk capital: Trading should only be done with risk capital, and only people with enough of it should consider trading. It is not advisable to trade with capital that can affect one's way of life or one's financial commitments.
    Market volatility: The code scripts and the strategies/techniques/models provided here are contingent upon the market's state and may not yield anticipated results during periods of high market volatility or atypical occurrences.
    - No promises: Trading losses are possible, and neither success nor profit are certain.
3. Additional notes <a id='three'></a>
    - Before implementing any code script and the strategies/techniques/models provided here, you must conduct independent research and due diligence.
    - Trading involves emotions, and managing your emotions and risk tolerance is crucial.
4. Accountability
    - By utilizing these code scripts and the strategies/techniques/models detailed in this repository, you agree that:
        - You have read and understood the disclaimer and points [1](#one), [2](#two) and [3](#three).
        - You assume full accountability for your trading and investing decisions.
        - You alone will bear responsibility for any losses incurred if you employ this trading setup and approach.
