# The Boruta-Shap Algorithm: A CPU-and-GPU version

## Introduction 
After you do feature engineering, feature importance is a key step before deploying a strategy backtesting code. Boruta-Shap comes as a viable source for that purpose. However, this algorithm might take a lot of time to run with large datasets. This unique article provides us with an estimation of the mentioned algorithm using CPU parallelism and GPU to make it run faster. Code will be implemented using the XGBoost library and futures library for CPU parallelism.
