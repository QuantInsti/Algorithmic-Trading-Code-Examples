# The Triple Barrier Method: A Python GPU-based computation

## Introduction 
Whenever you start using a lot of data to backtest a strategy and you would like to use the triple-barrier method, youâ€™ll face the issue of low time efficiency by running a CPU-based computation.
A course on backtesting can provide insights into handling large-scale data efficiently, equipping you with the skills to optimise backtesting processes and implement advanced methodologies in your trading strategies.
This article provides a great Nvidia-GPU-based solution code that you can implement and get much quicker the desired prediction feature.
