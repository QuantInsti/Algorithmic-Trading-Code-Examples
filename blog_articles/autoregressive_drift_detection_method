# A novel drift detection algorithm for machine learning in trading


## Introduction 
Imagine yourself, a great retail trader with an algorithm that flawlessly predicts stock movements for months—until a surprise Fed rate hike sends markets into chaos. Overnight, the model’s accuracy plummets. Why? Concept drift: your model no longer finds patterns in historical data and now underperforms its predictions. For machine-learning-based traders, this is a latent enemy.

But, what if you could detect these shifts in real time and adapt instantly?

Enter ADDM (Autoregressive Drift Detection Method), a game-changing algorithm that turns regime changes into opportunity.

In this guide, we’ll unpack how ADDM works, why it outperforms well-known models, and how traders can harness it to stay ahead of unpredictable markets.
