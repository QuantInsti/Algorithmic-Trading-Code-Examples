# The TGAN Algorithm for Trading

#### In this blog, we want you to present one of the advanced data analysis techniques available in Python to the quant trading community to support their research ambitions. It has been done in a simple and hands-on manner. 

## Introduction 
You’ll encounter situations where daily financial data is insufficient to backtest a strategy. However, synthetic data, following the same real data distribution, can be extremely useful to backtest a strategy with a sufficient number of observations. The Generative adversarial network, a.k.a GAN, will help us create synthetic data. Specifically, we’ll use the GAN model for time series data.
