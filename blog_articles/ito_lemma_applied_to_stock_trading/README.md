# Ito's Lemma Applied to Stock Trading

## Introduction 
This is the second part of the two-part blog where we explore how Ito’s Lemma extends traditional calculus to model the randomness in financial markets. Using real-world examples and Python code, we’ll break down concepts like drift, volatility, and geometric Brownian motion, showing how they help us understand and model financial data, and we’ll also have a sneak peek into how to use the same for trading in the markets.
