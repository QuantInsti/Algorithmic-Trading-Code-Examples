# The Risk-Constrained Kelly Criterion

## Introduction 
The Kelly Criterion is good enough for long-term trading where the investor is risk-neutral and can handle big drawdowns. However, we cannot accept long-duration and big drawdowns in real trading. To overcome the big drawdowns caused by the Kelly Criterion, Busseti et al. (2016) offered a risk-constrained Kelly Criterion that incorporates maximizing the long-term log-growth rate together with the drawdown as a constraint. This constraint allows us to have a smoother equity curve. You will learn everything about the new type of Kelly Criterion here and apply a trading strategy to it.
