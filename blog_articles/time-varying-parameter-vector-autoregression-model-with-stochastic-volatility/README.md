# A time-varying-parameter vector autoregression model with stochastic volatility

## Introduction 
The basic Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is heavily used in macro-econometrics for explanatory purposes and forecasting purposes in trading. In recent years, a VAR model with time-varying parameters has been used to understand the interrelationships between macroeconomic variables. This article extends the model usage to something our audience greatly cares about: trading! Youâ€™ll learn the basics of the estimation procedure and how to create a trading strategy based on the model.
